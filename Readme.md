# Notes app

A simple notes app for creating, editing and deleting notes built on meteor created for my course.

## Getting Started

This app requires you to have meteor and node installed. Then you can clone the repo and run the following from the command line.

```
meteor npm install
```

```
meteor
```

## Running the tests

All you have to do is run the following command and view the reporter at localhost port 3000.

```
npm test
```
